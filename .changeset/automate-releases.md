Automate releases with GitHub Actions. A PR-time **changeset gate** (`.github/workflows/changeset-gate.yml`) validates changeset shape and requires a changeset for release-relevant changes, and a post-merge **release** workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) uses `changesets/action@v1` to open a "Version Packages" PR and, on merge, create a `v<version>` git tag and a GitHub Release. Adopts `@changesets/changelog-github` for richer changelog entries and adds a dependency-free changeset shape validator (`scripts/validate-changesets.mjs`) with tests. No npm publish; the package stays private and consumed direct-from-git. A new `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the contributor and maintainer release mechanics.
