Add local, per-developer overrides of a project's conventions. A developer can place a git-ignored `.rp.local.md` alongside the committed `.rp.md` to override a restricted subset of conventions for their own working copy: the local file wins per named unit and the committed file is inherited wherever the local file is silent. Because the file is git-ignored, it is never committed and never affects other contributors. The capability ships as skill documentation — a `Local overrides` step in the convention loader (`load.md`), a `README.md` note, and a `.gitignore` entry.
